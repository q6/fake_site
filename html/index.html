                <hr>
                <p>There are many planets in the universe. But none of them is as good as the blue one, Earth. Pluto is an exception to this rule. It is a small planet, a <i>dwarf planet</i>. Pluto is an ideal candidate for the next Deathstar. All one would need to do it drill a few holes and construct some bridges. If you are reading this it is very likely that you are on Earth. Planet Earth is home to it's glorious leader, <strong>Overlord Vader</strong>. The Overlord Vader controls anything and everything in the northern hemisphere. But this is not the only reason that this is the best planet. Here are some other ones.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be seen from outer space</li>
                    <li>Is decently round, like the Deathstar was</li>
                    <li>Has many beaches, which the Deathstar did not</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Comparing Pluto to Earth</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Let's take a close look at how Pluto and Earth compare, and why Pluto comes out on top.</p>
                <table border="1">
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Earth</th>
                        <th>Pluto</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Radius</td>
                        <td>6,371km</td>
                        <td>1,184km</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Distance to Sun</td>
                        <td>0.14b miles</td>
                        <td>3.76b miles</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Population</td>
                        <td>7b</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Beaches?</td>
                        <td>Yes</td>
                        <td>No</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Looking at these results there is no question that Pluto is the better planet. The only thing that Earth has which Pluto does not, is the beaches. This is only matter of personal preference for Vader. If it wasn't for the beaches Vader would no longer be living on this planet but rather on the soon to be Deathstar.</p>
